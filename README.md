### in modern web app services, recommendation systems have become a commonly used and valuable underlying service, playing a critical role in personalizing user experiences across various platforms, from e-commerce sites to social media applications. This paper explores the development of recommendation systems, theoretical knowledge, mathematical methods, and application scenarios. Using Jupyter as a tool and a local computer as the server, a simple prototype demo of a recommendation system was built, with a front-end web page provided for testing. Future work will explore integrating this recommendation system into a practical projectâ€”NTUBUZZSPOT, a campus event publishing platform, to provide personalized recommendations for students and teachers.
